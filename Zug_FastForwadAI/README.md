# Fast Forward AI Turns
## General
This mod modifies the settings so that whenever an AI player is playing their turn (including Barbarians and City States), they will utilize both Quick Combat and Quick Movement to speed things up. These settings will not be changed for any players. This is generally useful for when you want the slower movement/combat for you, but don't want to the AI turns to be slow.



Extension:
If you want to change your options to allow for specifying when the attack animations should be quick or not when it is not your turn, you can download the Options Extension to specify what you prefer.
