# Skip Free Cities From Loyalty Pressure
![Logo Image](./SkipFreeCity_1.png)

## General
This mod will skip the 'Free City' stage when Loyalty falls too low, and will instead give it to the Civilization that has the most Loyalty pressure to it. A city with no Loyalty pressure from a major civilization can still become a Free City.

Any foreign city that leaves its civilization due to loss of Loyalty and is receiving the most Loyalty pressure from all cities instantly joins that empire, instead of becoming a Free City.

Eleanor of Aquitaine also has received a buff due to these changes:
"Great Works in Eleanor's cities each cause -1.5 Loyalty per turn in foreign cities within 9 tiles. Cities that Eleanor captures through Loyalty will always have 100% Loyalty to Eleanor."
